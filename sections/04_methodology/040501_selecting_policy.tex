\section{Lateral Transshipment Policy Selection}

\begin{itemize}
\item Number of items: N, arbitrary (why?
\item Number of echelons: Not relevant other than warehouse proximity to customers important, since the aim is to increase CIV? Hmm.
\item Number of locations: N, arbitrary
\item Identical locations: yes, because what matters is the item (CIV) and transshipment cost, not the warehouse
\item Unsatisfied demand: Lost sales because Internet
\item Orders: Irrelevant because we take a snapshot of the supply chain where ordering is included
\item Type of transshipment: Combine reactive / proactive because we do reactive transshipments on a regular basis
\item Pooling: Partial, because part of inventory is held back to cover future (next week's) demand
\end{itemize}
