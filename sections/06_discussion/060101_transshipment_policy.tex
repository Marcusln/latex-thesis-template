* Link to SLRP Lee et al. (2007)?
  * Combine proactive and reactive as mentioned in Paterson (2011), use SLRP from Lee (2007).

1.	Predict stockout on a weekly basis (proactive)
2.	If stockout is likely in a warehouse (reactive), take inventory from a warehouse with (the most) surplus inventory to the stockout warehouse
3.	Transship as much as possible of the excess inventory up until the optimal inventory level

*	ABC, ie one stragegy for A = fast items, B = slow, C = ultraslow etc, from risk pooling ref book? 
  * Fast: Optimize for recall
  * Slow: Optimize for precision
